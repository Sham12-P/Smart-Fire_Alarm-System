# Smart-Fire_Alarm-System
This system is an automated fire detection system that, upon detection of a fire, will take proactive efforts to warn the appropriate persons in addition to raising the alarm as a traditional fire detection system. It is built with Node MCU, Fire Sensor Buzzer, and the Blynk App (to receive notifications and send emails). All components communicate with the NodeMCU and operate automatically in accordance with the submitted code. When a fire is discovered inside the deployed area, a message of the fire accident will be sent to our mobile device, along with an alert email and the alarm buzzing, notifying those around.
